# CMPG-323-Project2---32397798
### Overview of the project and all the tasks
I started by creating my Azure student account and created a Server and Database on Azure.
Secondly I connected my SQL SSMS with my Azure database.
I then created my Visual Studio .NET Core Web API project and followed the documents provided.
After the code was finished I published the project to Azure and connected it to Github.

### Problem I have encountered
I encoutered alot of problems with the SQL database and the script that to create the tables, the API HTTPS creation 
came with alot of set backs and took alot of my time.
